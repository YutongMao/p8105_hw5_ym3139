# Problem 0

For this assignment, I created a public GitHub repository named
`p8105_hw5_ym3139` along with an R project of the same name. All data
files required for the assignment are stored in the `data/` subdirectory
and accessed via relative paths. All code for Problems 1 through 3 is
contained within a single R Markdown file, `p8105_hw5_ym3139.Rmd`, which
is rendered in `github_document` format.

# Problem 1

In this study, I employed a simulation approach to investigate the
birthday paradox. For groups ranging from 2 to 50 individuals, I
estimated the probability that at least two members share the same
birthday through 10,000 simulation runs.

``` r
# Function to simulate birthdays for a group and check for duplicates
check_birthday_match <- function(n) {
  
  # Simulate n birthdays as integers from 1 to 365
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  # Check whether there is at least one duplicated birthday
  any_duplicated <- any(duplicated(birthdays))
  
  # Return TRUE if there is a shared birthday, FALSE otherwise
  any_duplicated
}
```

``` r
check_birthday_match(2)    # very small group, low chance of match
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
check_birthday_match(50)   # larger group, higher chance of match
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
set.seed(1)  # set seed for reproducibility

# Create a data frame of all simulation settings
bday_sim_results <- 
  expand_grid(
    group_size = 2:50,      # number of people in the room
    iter       = 1:10000    # simulation iteration index
  ) |>
  mutate(
    # For each row, run the birthday function once
    has_match = map_lgl(group_size, check_birthday_match)
  ) |>
  group_by(group_size) |>
  summarize(
    # Estimated probability of at least one shared birthday
    prob_match = mean(has_match)
  )

# Look at the first few rows of the results
bday_sim_results
```

``` r
# Plot the estimated probability as a function of group size
bday_sim_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob_match)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Group size (number of people)",
    y = "Estimated probability of shared birthday",
    title = "Birthday problem: simulation-based estimates"
  )

As shown in the chart, the probability of at least two people sharing a
birthday increases rapidly as the group size expands. When fewer than 10
people are in the room, this probability approaches 0; when the group
size reaches just over 20 people, the probability is approximately 0.5;
and when the number of people reaches around 50, the probability
approaches 1. This suggests that our intuition about the birthday
problem may underestimate how quickly the probability increases with
group size.
