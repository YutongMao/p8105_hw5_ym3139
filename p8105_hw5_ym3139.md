# Problem 0

For this assignment, I created a public GitHub repository named
`p8105_hw5_ym3139` along with an R project of the same name. All data
files required for the assignment are stored in the `data/` subdirectory
and accessed via relative paths. All code for Problems 1 through 3 is
contained within a single R Markdown file, `p8105_hw5_ym3139.Rmd`, which
is rendered in `github_document` format.

# Problem 1

In this study, I employed a simulation approach to investigate the
birthday paradox. For groups ranging from 2 to 50 individuals, I
estimated the probability that at least two members share the same
birthday through 10,000 simulation runs.
