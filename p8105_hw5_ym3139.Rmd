# Problem 0
For this assignment, I created a public GitHub repository named `p8105_hw5_ym3139` along with an R project of the same name. All data files required for the assignment are stored in the `data/` subdirectory and accessed via relative paths.
All code for Problems 1 through 3 is contained within a single R Markdown file, `p8105_hw5_ym3139.Rmd`, which is rendered in `github_document` format.

# Problem 1
In this study, I employed a simulation approach to investigate the birthday paradox.
For groups ranging from 2 to 50 individuals, I estimated the probability that at least two members share the same birthday through 10,000 simulation runs.
