# p8105_hw5_ym3139
This repository contains my solutions for Homework 5 in P8105.  
All work is completed in the R Markdown file `p8105_hw5_ym3139.Rmd`, which is knitted to `p8105_hw5_ym3139.md`.  
Data files are stored in the `data/` folder and are accessed using relative paths.  
The project is organized as an R Project and tracked with Git/GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

- **Problem 1:** Simulation of the birthday problem; estimated the probability of shared birthdays for group sizes 2–50 and visualized the results.
- **Problem 2:** Simulation study of power for a one-sample t-test across multiple true means; created plots of power and examined selection bias.
- **Problem 3:** Analysis of Washington Post homicide data; summarized total and unsolved cases by city, applied `prop.test`, and created a plot of estimated proportions with confidence intervals.

All code, figures, and explanations are contained within the `.Rmd` file.
